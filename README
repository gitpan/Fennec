NAME
    Fennec - Framework upon which intercompatible testing solutions can be
    built.

DESCRIPTION
    Fennec provides a solid base that is highly extendable. It allows for
    the writing of custom nestable workflows (like RSPEC), Custom Asserts
    (like Test::Exception), Custom output handlers (Alternatives to TAP),
    Custom file types, and custom result passing (collectors). In Fennec all
    test files are objects. Fennec also solves the forking problem, thats
    it, forking just plain works.

    even unimplemented. Please give it a try and report any bugs or
