Fennec::Manual::Running - Tips for running fennec

=head3 Line number gotchas

Fennec maps groups and workflows based on their starting line number. If you
specify a line number before the number returned by L<B> then the group or
workflow defined before it will be chosen.

A general rule is that the first non-codeblock statement within the item will
be the first line number for the group/workflow.

In this example line 2 will be considered the first line of the 'example a'
test group.

    1: tests 'example a' => sub {
    2:     my $x = 'x';
    2: };

In this example line 5 is the line returned by L<B> when checking the line
number for the test group 'example b'.

    1: tests 'example b' => sub {
    2:    thing_that_takes_code_block {
    3:        ...
    4:    };
    5:    my $x = 'x';
    6: };
