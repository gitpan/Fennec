=head1 NAME

Fennec - A test helper providing RSPEC, Workflows, Parallelization, and Encapsulation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Fennec started as a project to improve the state of testing in Perl. Fennec
looks to existing solutions for most problems, so long as the existing
solutions help meet the features listed below.

=head1 API STABILITY

Fennec versions below 1.000 were considered experimental, and the API was
subject to change. As of version 1.0 the API is considered stabalized. New
versions may add functionality, but not remove or significantly alter existing
functionality.

=head1 FEATURES

=over 4

=item Forking Works

Forking in tests just plain works. You can fork, and run assertions (tests) in
both processes.

=item Test groups can be run alone

Encapsulated test groups can be run individually, without running the entire
file. (See L<Test::Workflow>)

=item Parallelization within test files

Encapsulated test groups can be run in parallel if desired. (On by default with
up to 3 processes)

=item Test reordering

Tests groups can be sorted, randomized, or sorted via a custom method. (see
L<Test::Workflow>)

=item Test::Builder and Test::Builder2 compatibility

Fennec is compatible with L<Test::Builder> based tools. Test::Builder2 support
is in-place, but experimental until Test::Builder2 is officially released.

=item Ability to decouple from Test::Builder

Fennec is configurable to work on alternatives to L<Test::Builder>.

=item No need to formally end tests

You do not need to put anything such as done_testing() at the end of your test file.

=item Test counting is handled for you

You do not need to worry about test counts.

=item Diagnostic messages are grouped with the failed test

Annoyed when your test failure and the diagnostics messages about that test are
decoupled?

    ok 1 - foo
    ok 2 - bar
    not ok 3 - baz
    ok 4 - bannana
    ok 5 - pear
    # Test failure on line 67
    # expected: 'baz'
    #      got: 'bazz'

This happens because normal output is sent to STDOUT, while errors are sent to
STDERR. This is important in a non-verbose harness so that you can still see
error messages. In a verbose harness however it is just plain annoying. Fennec
checks the verbosity of the harness, and sends diagnostic messages to STDOUT
when the harness is verbose.

B<Note:> This is not IO redirection or handle manipulation, your warnings and
errors will still go to STDERR.

=back

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyTest;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Fennec;

    tests foo => sub {
        ok( 1, 'bar' );
    };

    tests another => sub {
        ok( 1, 'something passed' );
    };

    tests not_ready => (
        todo => "Feature not implemented",
        code => sub { ... },
    );

    tests very_not_ready => (
        skip => "These tests will die if run"
        code => sub { ... },
    );

    1;

By default these test groups will be run in parallel. They will also be run in
random order by default. See the L</CONFIGURATION> for more details on
controlling behavior. Also see L<Test::Workflow> for more useful and poweful
test groups and structures.

=head2 FRIENDLIER INTERFACE

B<If you use L<Fennec::Declare> you can write tests like this:>

    package MyTest;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Fennec;

    tests foo {
        ok( 1, 'bar' );
    }

    1;

Thats right, no C<=E<gt> sub> and no trailing ';'.

=head1 RUNNING ONLY A SPECIFIC GROUP

     1: package MyTest;
     2: use strict;
     3: use warnings;
     4: use Fennec;
     5:
     6: tests foo => sub {
     7:     ok( 1, 'bar' );
     8: };
     9:
    10: tests another => sub {
    11:    ok( 1, 'something passed' );
    12: };
    13:
    14: 1;

In the above code there are 2 test groups, 'foo', and 'another'. If you wanted,
you could run just one, without the others running. Fennec looks at the
'FENNEC_TEST' environment variable. If the variable is set to a string, then
only the test groups with that string as a name will run.

    $ FENNEC_TEST="foo" prove -Ilib -v t/FennecTest.t

In addition, you could provide a line number, and only the test group defined
across that line will be run. For example, to run 'foo' you could give the line
number 6, 7 or 8 to run that group alone.

    $ FENNEC_TEST="7" prove -Ilib -v t/FennecTest.t

This will run only test 'foo'. The use of line numbers makes editor integration
very easy. Most editors will let you bind a key to running the above command
replacing t/FennecTest.t with the current file, and automatically inserting the
current line into FENNEC_TEST.

=head1 EDITOR INTEGRATION

=head2 VI/VIM

Insert this into your .vimrc file to bind the F8 key to running the current
test in the current file:

    function! RunFennecLine()
        let cur_line = line(".")
        exe "!FENNEC_TEST='" . cur_line . "' prove -v -I lib %"
    endfunction

    " Go to command mode, save the file, run the current test
    :map <F8> <ESC>:w<cr>:call RunFennecLine()<cr>
    :imap <F8> <ESC>:w<cr>:call RunFennecLine()<cr>

=head1 MODULES LOADED AUTOMATICALLY WITH FENNEC

=over 4

=item L<Test::More>

The standard perl test library.

=item L<Test::Exception>

One of the more useful test libraries, used to test code that throws exceptions
(dies).

=item L<Test::Warn>

Test code that issues warnings.

=item L<Test::Workflow>

Provides RSPEC, and several other workflow related helpers. Also provides the
test group encapsulation.

=item L<Mock::Quick>

Quick and effective mocking with no action at a distance side effects.

=back

=head1 MODULES FENNEC MAKES AN EFFORT TO SUPPORT

=over 4

=item L<Test::Class>

A Fennec class can also be a Test::Class class.

=item L<Test::Builder>

If Fennec did not support this who would use it?

=item L<Test::Builder2>

There is currently experimental support for Test::Builder2. Once Test::Builder2
is officially released, support will be finalized.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

There are 2 ways to configure Fennec. One is to specify configuration options
at import. The other is to subclass Fennec and override the defaults() method.

Configuration options:

=head3 utils => [ qw/ModuleA ModuleB .../ ]

Provide a list of modules to load. They will be imported as if you typed
C<use MODULE>.

You can specify arguments for each class like so:

    use Fennec utils => [ 'My::Util' ],
          'My::Util' => [ 'Arg1', 'Arg2' ];

=head3 parallel => $MAX

Specify the maximum number of processes Fennec should use to run your tests.
Set to 0 to never create a new process. Depedning on conditions 1 MAY fork for
test groups while still only running 1 at a time, but this behavior is not
guarenteed.

Default: 3

=head3 runner_class => $CLASS

Specify the runner class. Default: L<Fennec::Runner>

=head3 with_tests => \@CLASSES

Load test_groups and workflows from another class. This allows you to put test
groups common to many test files into a single place for re-use.

=head3 test_sort => $SORT

This sets the test sorting method for Test::Workflow test groups.  Accepts
'random', 'sort', a codeblock, or 'ordered'. This uses a fuzzy matching, you
can use the shorter versions 'rand', and 'ord'.

Defaults to: 'rand'

=over 4

=item 'random'

Will shuffle the order. Keep in mind Fennec sets the random seed using the date
so that tests will be determinate on the day you write them, but random
over time.

=item 'sort'

Sort the test groups by name. When multiple tests are wrapped in before_all or
after_all the describe/cases block name will be used.

=item 'ordered'

Use the order in which the test groups were defined.

=item sub { my @tests = @_; ...; return @new_tests }

Specify a custom method of sorting. This is not the typical sort {} block, $a
and $b will not be set.

=back

=head2 AT IMPORT

    use Fennec parallel => 5,
                  utils => [ 'My::Util' ],
                  ... Other Options ...;

=head2 BY SUBCLASS

    package My::Fennec;
    use base 'Fennec';

    sub defaults {(
        utils => [qw/
            Test::More Test::Warn Test::Exception Test::Workflow
        /],
        utils_with_args => {
            My::Util => [qw/function_x function_y/],
        },
        parallel => 5,
        runner_class => 'Fennec::Runner',
    )}

    # Hook, called after import
    sub init {
        my $class = shift;
        # All parameters passed to import(), as well as caller => [...] and meta => $meta
        my %params = @_;

        ...
    }

    1;

=head1 MORE COMPLETE EXAMPLE

This is a more complete example than that which is given in the synopsis. Most
of this actually comes from L<Method::Workflow>, See those docs for more
details. Significant sections are in seperate headers, but all examples should
be considered part of the same long test file.

B<NOTE:> All blocks, including setup/teardown are methods, you can shift @_ to
get $self.

=head2 BASIC EXAMPLES

    package MyTest;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Fennec parallel   => 2,
               with_tests => [qw/ Test::TemplateA Test::TemplateB /],
               test_sort  => 'rand';

    # Tests can be at the package level
    use_ok( 'MyClass' );

    # Fennec works with Test::Class
    use base 'Test::Class';

    sub tc_test : Test(1) {
        my $self = shift;
        ok( 1, 'This is a Test::Class test' );
    }

    tests loner => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        ok( 1, "1 is the loneliest number... " );
    };

    tests not_ready => (
        todo => "Feature not implemented",
        code => sub { ... },
    );

    tests very_not_ready => (
        skip => "These tests will die if run"
        code => sub { ... },
    );

=head2 RSPEC WORKFLOW

Here setup/teardown methods are declared in the order in which they are run,
but they can really be declared anywhere within the describe block and the
behavior will be identical.

    describe example => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        my $number = 0;
        my $letter = 'A';

        before_all setup => sub { $number = 1 };

        before_each letter_up => sub { $letter++ };

        # it() is an alias for tests()
        it check => sub {
            my $self = shift;
            is( $letter, 'B', "Letter was incremented" );
            is( $number, 2,   "number was incremented" );
        };

        after_each reset => sub { $number = 1 };

        after_all teardown => sub {
            is( $number, 1, "number is back to 1" );
        };

        describe nested => sub {
            # This nested describe block will inherit before_each and
            # after_each from the parent block.
            ...
        };

        describe maybe_later => (
            todo => "We might get to this",
            code => { ... },
        );
    };

=head3 FENNEC'S RSPEC IMPROVEMENT

Fennec add's to the RSPEC toolset with the around keyword.

    describe addon => sub {
        my $self = shift;

        around_each localize_env => sub {
            my $self = shift;
            my ( $inner ) = @_;

            local %ENV = ( %ENV, foo => 'bar' );

            $inner->();
        };

        tests foo => sub {
            is( $ENV{foo}, 'bar', "in the localized environment" );
        };
    };

=head2 CASE WORKFLOW

Cases are used when you have a test that you wish to run under several r tests
conditions. The following is a trivial example. Each test will be run once
under each case. B<Beware!> this will run (cases x tests), with many tests and
cases this can be a huge set of actual tests. In this example 8 in total will
be run.

B<Note:> The 'cases' keyword is an alias to describe. case blocks can go into
any workflow and will work as expected.

    cases check_several_numbers => sub {
        my $number;
        case one => sub { $number = 2 };
        case one => sub { $number = 4 };
        case one => sub { $number = 6 };
        case one => sub { $number = 8 };

        tests is_even => sub {
            ok( !$number % 2, "number is even" );
        };

        tests only_digits => sub {
            like( $number, qr/^\d+$/i, "number is all digits" );
        };
    };

=head1 MOCKING FROM MOCK::QUICK

L<Mock::Quick> is imported by default. L<Mock::Quick> is a powerful mocking
library with a very friendly syntax.

=head2 MOCKING OBJECTS

    use Mock::Quick;

    my $obj = obj(
        foo => 'bar',            # define attribute
        do_it => qmeth { ... },  # define method
        ...
    );

    is( $obj->foo, 'bar' );
    $obj->foo( 'baz' );
    is( $obj->foo, 'baz' );

    $obj->do_it();

    # define the new attribute automatically
    $obj->bar( 'xxx' );

    # define a new method on the fly
    $obj->baz( qmeth { ... });

    # remove an attribute or method
    $obj->baz( qclear() );

=head2 MOCKING CLASSES

    use Mock::Quick;

    my $control = qclass(
        # Insert a generic new() method (blessed hash)
        -with_new => 1,

        # Inheritance
        -subclass => 'Some::Class',
        # Can also do
        -subclass => [ 'Class::A', 'Class::B' ],

        # generic get/set attribute methods.
        -attributes => [ qw/a b c d/ ],

        # Method that simply returns a value.
        simple => 'value',

        # Custom method.
        method => sub { ... },
    );

    my $obj = $control->packahe->new;

    # Override a method
    $control->override( foo => sub { ... });

    # Restore it to the original
    $control->restore( 'foo' );

    # Remove the anonymous namespace we created.
    $control->undefine();

=head2 TAKING OVER EXISTING CLASSES

    use Mock::Quick;

    my $control = qtakeover( 'Some::Package' );

    # Override a method
    $control->override( foo => sub { ... });

    # Restore it to the original
    $control->restore( 'foo' );

    # Destroy the control object and completely restore the original class Some::Package.
    $control = undef;

=head2 MOCKING EXPORTS

Mock-Quick uses L<Exporter::Declare>. This allows for exports to be prefixed or renamed.
See L<Exporter::Declare/RENAMING IMPORTED ITEMS> for more information.

=over 4

=item $obj = qobj( attribute => value, ... )

Create an object. Every possible attribute works fine as a get/set accessor.
You can define other methods using qmeth {...} and assigning that to an
attribute. You can clear a method using qclear() as an argument.

See L<Mock::Quick::Object> for more.

=item $control = qclass( -config => ..., name => $value || sub { ... }, ... )

Define an anonymous package with the desired methods and specifications.

See L<Mock::Quick::Class> for more.

=item $control = qtakeover( $package )

Take control over an existing class.

See L<Mock::Quick::Class> for more.

=item qclear()

Returns a special reference that when used as an argument, will cause
Mock::Quick::Object methods to be cleared.

=item qmeth { my $self = shift; ... }

Define a method for an L<Mock::Quick::Object> instance.

=head1 NOTES

When you C<use Fennec>, it will check to see if you called the file directly.
If you directly called the file Fennec will restart Perl and run your test
through L<Fennec::Runner>.

=head1 CAVEATS

When running a test group by line, Fennec takes it's best guess at which group
the line number represents. There are 2 ways to get the line number of a
codeblock:

The first is to use the L<B> module. The L<B> module will return the
line of the first statement within the codeblock.

The other is to define the codeblock in a function call, such as
C<tests foo =E<gt> sub {...}>, tests() can then use caller() which will return
the last line of the statement.

Combining these methods, we can get the approximate starting and ending lines
for codeblocks defined through Fennec's keywords.

This will break if you do something like:

    tests foo => \&my_test;
    sub my_test { ... }

But might work just fine if you do:

    tests foo => \&my_test;
    sub my_test { ... }

But might run both tests in this case when asking to run 'baz' by line number:

    tests foo => \&my_test;
    tests baz => sub {... }
    sub my_test { ... }
